# Atomic-Anchor: Leveraging Structural Divergence via Community-Driven Graph Neural Networks for Robust Traffic Anomaly Detection #

## Abstract ##

Stealthy network attacks increasingly evade detection by mimicking the feature distributions of benign traffic, rendering traditional point-based analysis ineffective. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) possess the capability to capture relational dependencies, their indiscriminate aggregation mechanism often induces relational smearing, which sequentially leads to feature smearing that blurs the structural boundaries between legitimate flows and adversarial noise. This paper proposes Atomic-Anchor, an unsupervised framework that identifies anomalies by exploiting a fundamental structural dichotomy inherent in network topology. We observe that benign traffic naturally manifests as atomized micro-communities within specific business contexts, characterized by weak internal correlations and sparse external coupling. In contrast, coordinated malicious activities form highly cohesive aggregates due to their collaborative nature, with flows tightly coupled through functional or causal dependencies. To leverage this divergence, Atomic-Anchor introduces a community-driven GNN architecture that employs isolation masking to ensure structural purity and prevent cross-community information contamination. Furthermore, we design a dual-granularity optimization strategy that preserves intra-community diversity while driving benign representations toward stable atomic anchors in a latent manifold. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on 36 collaborative attack types show that Atomic-Anchor effectively amplifies structural divergence between legitimate atoms and malicious clusters. It achieves an F1-score of 98.3% and outperforms SOTA baselines by a relative average of 21.4%, establishing a robust geometric baseline for detecting sophisticated, coordinated threats.

### Overview ###

Atomic-Anchor is an unsupervised framework designed to identify stealthy network attacks by exploiting the structural dichotomy between "atomized" benign micro-communities and "aggregated" malicious subgraphs. The design framework of Atomic-Anchor is shown in the figure. First, the **Topology-Enhanced Graph Construction** module maps physical communication links and infers latent semantic associations to formulate a heterogeneous interaction graph, within which a **Community-Driven Atomicity Partitioning** process is executed to delineate benign traffic boundaries via weighted modularity. Subsequently, the core **Atomic-Anchor Graph Neural Network (A2GNN)** utilizes these partitioned communities to guide its community-aware message passing and dual-granularity self-supervised optimization, which effectively suppresses cross-community feature smearing while driving benign embeddings toward stable anchors. Finally, the **Anomaly Detection via Structural Divergence** module identifies threats by computing the minimum manifold distance between test flow embeddings and the calibrated atomic anchors, thereby capturing both individual deviations and coordinated structural anomalies.
